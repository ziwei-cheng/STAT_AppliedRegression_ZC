Estimating heritability [1/6] for: sud.sumstats.gz
     
Please note that the results initially printed to the screen and log file reflect the NON-liability h2 and cov_g. However, a liability conversion is being used for trait sud.sumstats.gz when creating the genetic covariance matrix used as input for Genomic SEM and liability scale results are printed at the end of the log file.
