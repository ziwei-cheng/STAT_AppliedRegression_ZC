Munging file: ./opi.DEPvEXP_trans.ancestry.noAF.tbl
Interpreting the RSID column as the SNP column.
Interpreting the ALLELE1 column as the A1 column.
Interpreting the ALLELE2 column as the A2 column.
Interpreting the ZSCORE column as the effect column.
Interpreting the P.VALUE column as the P column.
Interpreting the  WEIGHT  column as the N (sample size) column.
Interpreting the  TOTAL_N  column as the N (sample size) column.
Merging file: ./opi.DEPvEXP_trans.ancestry.noAF.tbl with the reference file: ./w_hm3.noMHC.snplist
4000397 rows present in the full ./opi.DEPvEXP_trans.ancestry.noAF.tbl summary statistics file.
3240176 rows were removed from the ./opi.DEPvEXP_trans.ancestry.noAF.tbl summary statistics file as the rs-ids for these rows were not present in the reference file.
8 row(s) were removed from the ./opi.DEPvEXP_trans.ancestry.noAF.tbl summary statistics file due to the effect allele (A1) column not matching A1 or A2 in the reference file.
No INFO column, cannot filter on INFO, which may influence results
No MAF column, cannot filter on MAF, which may influence results
760213 SNPs are left in the summary statistics file ./opi.DEPvEXP_trans.ancestry.noAF.tbl after QC.
I am done munging file: ./opi.DEPvEXP_trans.ancestry.noAF.tbl
The file is saved as sud.sumstats.gz in the current working directory.
     
     
Munging file: ./pts_eur_freeze2_overall.results
Interpreting the SNP column as the SNP column.
Interpreting the A1 column as the A1 column.
Interpreting the A2 column as the A2 column.
Interpreting the OR column as the effect column.
Interpreting the INFO column as the INFO column.
Interpreting the P column as the P column.
Interpreting the  NCA  column as the N_CAS (sample size for cases) column.
Interpreting the  NCO  column as the N_CON (sample size for controls) column.
As the file includes both N_CAS and N_CON columns, the summation of these two columns will be used as the total sample size
Merging file: ./pts_eur_freeze2_overall.results with the reference file: ./w_hm3.noMHC.snplist
9766174 rows present in the full ./pts_eur_freeze2_overall.results summary statistics file.
8581264 rows were removed from the ./pts_eur_freeze2_overall.results summary statistics file as the rs-ids for these rows were not present in the reference file.
The effect column was determined to be coded as an odds ratio (OR) for the ./pts_eur_freeze2_overall.results summary statistics file. Please ensure this is correct.
191 row(s) were removed from the ./pts_eur_freeze2_overall.results summary statistics file due to the effect allele (A1) column not matching A1 or A2 in the reference file.
114 row(s) were removed from the ./pts_eur_freeze2_overall.results summary statistics file due to the other allele (A2) column not matching A1 or A2 in the reference file.
14286 rows were removed from the ./pts_eur_freeze2_overall.results summary statistics file due to INFO values below the designated threshold of 0.9
No MAF column, cannot filter on MAF, which may influence results
1170319 SNPs are left in the summary statistics file ./pts_eur_freeze2_overall.results after QC.
I am done munging file: ./pts_eur_freeze2_overall.results
