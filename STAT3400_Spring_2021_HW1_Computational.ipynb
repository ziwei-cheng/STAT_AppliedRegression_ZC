Computational questions may require code, plots, analysis, interpretation, etc. Working in small groups is allowed, but it is important that you make an effort to master the material and hand in your own work.

    "(Same setup as theoretical problem 2): The random variable $X$ can take on the values 0,1,2, and 3 with probabilities $P(X = 0) = p^3$, $P(X = 1) = (1-p)p^2$, $P(X = 2) = (1-p)^2$, and $P(X = 3) = 2p(1-p)$, where $0 < p < 1$. Graph the log likelihood function in R and place a  vertical line at the MLE found in theoretical problem 2. Does it look like the correct maximizer?\n"
